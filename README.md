For the first time used styled-components(https://styled-components.com/) and know what?!) It was COOL!) very useful tool)


Also for this task used react-router-dom-v6.(https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6) There is some differences from previous version but they wrote a good docs)

For more fun - react-spinner(https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/) - highly recomended!)

So, how is it looks like:

And finally you can browse all photos that you add to favorites/like/dislikes

Most difficult part was set to wark react-dropzone(https://react-dropzone.js.org/), need more practice =(

For modal used ReactDom and added a portal (https://ru.reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html). common staff)

And for the comfort i added dark theme switcher) but let it be our secret):
